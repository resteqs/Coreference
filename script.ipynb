    "Aligns words from the CoNLL file with words from the TextGrid intervals using the *Needleman-Wunsch* algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Steps:\n",
    "    1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "       - Create a scoring matrix (`score_matrix`) of size (n+1) x (m+1), where n is the length of `conll_words` and m is the length of `textgrid_words`.\n",
    "       - Initialize the first row and column with cumulative gap penalties to represent alignments with leading gaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Scoring Matrix Construction:**\n",
    "       - Iterate over each cell in the matrix to compute the optimal score based on:\n",
    "         - **Match:** If the current words from `conll_words` and `textgrid_words` match, add a positive `match_score`.\n",
    "         - **Mismatch:** If the words do not match, add a negative `mismatch_penalty`.\n",
    "         - **Insertion/Deletion (Gaps):** Assign a negative `gap_penalty` for insertions or deletions.\n",
    "       - Calculate scores for:\n",
    "         - **Diagonal move (match/mismatch):** `score_matrix[i-1][j-1] + score`\n",
    "         - **Up move (deletion in TextGrid):** `score_matrix[i-1][j] + gap_penalty`\n",
    "         - **Left move (insertion in TextGrid):** `score_matrix[i][j-1] + gap_penalty`\n",
    "       - Select the move with the highest score and store it in `score_matrix[i][j]`.\n",
    "       - Record the move direction in the `traceback_matrix` for later path reconstruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **Traceback:**\n",
    "       - Start from the bottom-right cell of the matrices (`score_matrix[n][m]`).\n",
    "       - Reconstruct the optimal alignment by moving in the direction indicated by `traceback_matrix`:\n",
    "         - **'diag':** Align the current words from both sequences.\n",
    "         - **'up':** Align the word from `conll_words` with a gap (deletion in `textgrid_words`).\n",
    "         - **'left':** Align a gap with the word from `textgrid_words` (insertion in `conll_words`).\n",
    "       - Continue tracing back until reaching the top-left cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. **Results:**\n",
    "       - Obtain `aligned_conll` and `aligned_textgrid`, which are the aligned sequences including gaps ('-') where necessary.\n",
    "       - Collect corresponding time intervals from `textgrid_intervals` for aligned words.\n",
    "       - Reverse the aligned sequences and times to obtain the correct order.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Parameters:\n",
    "        conll_words (list): List of words extracted from the CoNLL file.\n",
    "        textgrid_intervals (list): List of dictionaries from the TextGrid file, each containing:\n",
    "                                   - \"word\": The word string.\n",
    "                                   - \"start_time\": Start time of the interval.\n",
    "                                   - \"end_time\": End time of the interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Returns:\n",
